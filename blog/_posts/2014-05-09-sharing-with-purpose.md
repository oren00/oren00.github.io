I've been on a hiatus from social media for some time.  My relationships with Twitter, Facebook, Instagram were always hit or miss.  I'd go through periods of using them for bursts and then leaving them behind.  In some cases moving on to trying new platforms.  I joined Facebook in 2006 as a college freshman.  I've learned that I need a purpose to do anything in life.  That purpose is mine to set.  I'm a goal setter and an overachiever.  If I don't set a direction, I'm usually lost and not enjoying myself.  I'v recently started using Twitter again, with purpose.  I've set goals for myself and check in nightly.

##Intention##
Setting an intention determines the purpose or reason for engagement.  It helps focus on, say, sharing design and tech related as opposed to photos of cats, food and other things that would dilute my intentions.  I wanted to leverage Twitter for a number of reasons relating to my career.  

After selecting a scope, it's easy to under stand the breath of my interactions on Twitter.  These would specifically focus on interactions with those in my discpline and those closely related.  The depth in interactions ranges from following people, starting conversations with people, contributing to conversations, sharing ideas, sharing topics, favouriting tweets and retweeting.  Basically engaging with similar people on topics relating to my professional ambitions.

##Attention##
Setting an attention level dictates how much you're willing to put into whatever it is you're intentending to do.  This could also be explained as frequency.  If I stopped at intention, I would have a 'what' without a 'how'.  I set qualitative and quantative goals, reoccuring daily.  This requires I spend some amount of time daily persuing my intention.  My attention to my purpose is engaging with other twitter users a set amount of times in each day, throughout the day.

##Sprinting##
Setting short cycles with clear success criteria allows an ongoing analysis into failure and success.  Shortening the time of the cycle allows for minimal failure and encourages positive trajectory.  My accountability would, at it's worst, allow for a failure of one day before the cycle resets.  What would be detrimental to morale would be working hard at something for a long amount of time, only to find you were paddling in the wrong direction.  In time I may increase the time of the sprint cycle, however for now I am keeping things to 24 hour cycles.

##Analysis##
Qualatative and quantative insights are the most holistic metric for determining positive trajectory.  Are you matching positive intention with positive attention.  For me this is "Am I engaging how I set, at the frequency I set" or high quality twitter interactions my benchmark number of times through each day.  Quantative is an easy metric for me to measure, just be looking at twitter and 

##Cheat##
Embracing succeeding at all costs may not guarantee success but it will guarantee action.  I don't necessarily believe in cheating, and 'hacking' might be more accurate terminology.  I scrape news sources for potential articles to share, skim through them as I normally would, hand pick the best ones and then schedule my tweets for peak times of the day.
