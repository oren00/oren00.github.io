##tl;dr;##
You're going to upset people, but life is too short not to experiment.  Get out of your comfort zone and get rid of the bullshit in your life.  You'll appreciate your freedom.

##Why?##
I became unpleased with my life.  I'm not sure when I realized it, but knew I had to change something drastic.  My pursuits in life were no longer in line with my values.  I realized I was trading my time for money in order to buy things which did not add value to my life.  These things began owning me, resulting in me trading more time for more money for more purchases.

I became obsessed with minimalism.  I care deeply about the ideas on which I'm focused.  I feel optimal when I have more control over these ideas, and less than optimal when someone is telling me the ideas on which focus ie. corporate management.  I was moving further away from my ideas, and began loosing the desire to chase them.  I decided to make a radical change which would result in me embracing a minimal and nomadic state of being in pursuit of the things which fuel me.

##Misaligned Values##

Financial freedom.  I forcibly lowered and maintain a low cost of living.

Clearness of mind.  If I have a cluttered mind, I have a cluttered space and vice versa.  Instead of surrounding myself with things, I removed them and surrounded myself with my ideas and passion projects.  If I have a cluttered mind now, I surround myself by thinking through things specially.

Focusing on intangibles - the only way was to reduce and remove the unnecessary tangibles.

Travel with little planning.  Nowadays I spend my time split between a few cities.  I'm still getting my bearings, however I travel on a whim.  My only bag is my carry-on luggage and nearly all of my daily things fit into it easily.

##On throwing things out##
My first leap was choosing to give up sleeping in a bed.  With no dependents or significant others in my life this was an option for me.  The bed signified a grounding to a particular location.  I replaced it once with a hammock and later with a cheap and mobile camping mat.  I've left a few of these in various cities so that I can travel light and always have a place to crash.  

I also rid myself of any comfort items in order to tackle comfort and anxiety head on.  This included tables, reading chairs, decorations, lamps, etc.  I donated everything I could not deal with parting with to thrift stores and made everything fit into my hatchback.  I've continuously reduced this.  I'm not one to play the whole 120 items game, yet.  My criteria for selection: "Does this thing enable me to be more productive?" if not get rid of it.

##Time tracking##
I also began experimenting with my new freedom by exploring time tracking in different ways.  This changes between holding consistent hours, sprints and cool off periods and late night sessions.  I'm an avid user of egg timer and tend to work best in 60 or 120 minute bursts.  I plan out each day and also each sprint throughout the day.  I'm not doing this to bill anyone, but to try to take my commodity, time, and get the most out of it.

##Financial tracking##
I know my burn rate and how long I can live on a variable income.  I'm still earning income, and have a nest egg, I just work for hire more sporadically as I'm not currently a wage slave.  This is some mix of consulting contracts, retainers, workshops, speaking engagements and soon our own products.  I use a spreadsheet to track my budget and expenses for the month.  I've slimmed these down dramatically and cut out most recurring comfort expenses.

##It freaks people out##
Most people can't grasp minimalism as it is a departure from the system which birthed us.  Instead of competing on ownership of objects you're operating in a completely different spectrum.  My closest friends don't get it, but they respect that I am pursuing decisions which increase my happiness.  Haters will hate - you do you.

##The catalyst##
I required a major event in my life to reshape my philosophies.  It started for me as an exodus out of the North East, away from a career in Corporate America.  Regardless of the magnitude, the effects can be tremendously powerful.
