Raised in New Orleans, I grew up in a world class culture.  Between music and food, I spent most of my former years developing a complex palette around a culture spicy in a multitude of ways.  I also picked up exploring, resulting in my value of road maps over directions.  Processes over recipes.  This follows my obsession with a system level framework which I've been developing and revealing.  This allows for freedom for experimentation within a guided approach.  Some, but not all of the variables are locked down as constants.

While chasing self actualization it is quite easy to let things like food go to the wayside.  Maslow places physiological needs as the base for everything else.  While I cannot help everyone around me with the actualization portion, I feed them.  They don't know the basis behind for this, yet.  All they know is when I am in Dallas at Fort Work, beans start cooking sometime early in the morning in a slow cooker in ready for the 12pm rush.  The smell engulfs the entire floor of the building.

Beans involve two separate stages in my dishes.  The first is repetitive soaking ~2 hours total.  This gets the beans tender, allows them to absorb all of the water they need first and removes the oligosaccharides (the cause of intestinal gas).  I soak the beans in hot (200 deg.) water, not necessarily boiling.  Dump out and wash beans three times in cold water, replacing with hot water and letting them sit for up to 24 hours.  The second involves cooking and seasoning.  I use a slow cooker and cook on low from 2am to 12pm with a timer.  If I'm cooking the day of, or in a rush I cook on high for half the time.  The beans always come out soft, but not sloppy.  We'll save that for curry.

I like how pinto, navy and kidney beans work out the best and combinations of these three are awesome together.  I don't measure out spices by volume.  I have a rule of thumb for dumping them in ratios and I usually season by feel and to taste.  Always under season and continue adding to approach ideal seasoning.

Produce:

-   2 lb dried beans (pinto and red kidney)
-   1/2 an onion
-   3 stalks celery
-   3 cloves garlic
-   1/2 green bell pepper
-   2 jalapeno

Spices:

-  3 tbsp Slap ya Mama (replaces salt and pepper)
-  3 tbsp cayenne
-  1 tbsp cumin
-  2 tsp thyme
-  2 tsp sage
-  2 tsp oregano
-  2 bay leaves

Fill up the pot with the produce, season, fill with water until 1" of water covers the mix, flick on, wait, eat, accomplish.
