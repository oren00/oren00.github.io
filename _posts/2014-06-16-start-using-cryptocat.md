##Encrypting your instant messages
Having a safe channel for communications is imperative in today's digital world.  It does not matter if you have something secret to share, the right to privacy is one of the core principles of the internet.  [Cryptocat](https://crypto.cat/) is a way to securely chat.

Figuring out how to set up and correctly encrypt messages can be a headache for casual users.  Cryptocat is a strong candidate mainly because the time to get going is minimal and the learning curve for use is very low.

What cryptocat does:

*	All parties join cryptocat, entering a conversation together
*	Messages between you and users are encrypted, meaning only the receiving parties can view them.
*	No logs of messages are kept once members leave the conversation.

What cryptocat doesn't do:

*	It is not anonymous.  You can choose your name, however your connection is not hidden.
*	It does not protect against keyloggers.  Cryptocat will not protect you against attacks on your machine.
*	It does not protect you from untrustworthy people.
